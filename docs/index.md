# Process Manager Documentation

Welcome to the Process Manager documentation. This documentation covers the design principles, implementation details, and API reference for the process management system.

## Getting Started

See the [Data Handling Quickstart](quickstart.md) for a quick overview of the data handling system used for inputs, outputs, and parameters (including resource files, etc.).

TODO: Add getting started guides and tutorials.

## Design Principles

The process manager is designed to be a flexible, extensible system that can handle various types of data processing tasks. It follows the following principles:
- **Modularity**: The system should be modular, allowing for easy addition or removal of components.
- **Flexibility**: The system should be flexible enough to accommodate different types of data and processing requirements.
- **Extensibility**: The system should be extensible, allowing for customization and integration with other systems.

## Core Components

- [Named Values](design/named_values.md): Type-safe value containers with validation
- [Random Variables](design/random_variables.md): Statistical distribution implementations

## API Reference

- [Data Handlers](reference/process_manager/data_handlers/index.md)
