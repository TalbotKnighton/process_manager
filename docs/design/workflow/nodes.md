This implementation provides:

1. A flexible workflow engine with support for serial and parallel execution
1. Process state tracking via ProcessState enum
1. Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
1. Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
1. Support for different types of processes (CLI, data transformation, API calls)
1. Configurable retry strategies with exponential backoff
1. Process validation rules
1. Workflow state serialization to JSON
1. Support for optional (non-critical) processes
1. Clean, type-hinted API that will work well with IDE autocompletion

Users can easily extend this framework by:

1. Creating new process implementations by subclassing BaseProcess
1. Adding custom validation rules
1. Configuring retry strategies
1. Building complex workflows with multiple parallel and serial branches
1. Implementing custom error handling strategies

The framework is also easily extensible for additional features like:

1. Workflow persistence
1. Process monitoring and logging
1. Workflow visualization
1. Distributed execution
1. Process checkpointing and resumption

Users can create arbitrarily complex workflows while maintaining type safety and data validation through Pydantic models. The async implementation allows for efficient parallel execution where possible, while the dependency system ensures proper ordering of operations.
